# AutoBanking Customer Service Workflow

An intelligent automated customer service pipeline for banking operations that leverages MindsDB AI agents to process customer interactions, classify issues, and generate actionable insights.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

This project implements an end-to-end automated workflow that transforms raw customer service interactions into structured, actionable business intelligence:

```
Raw Customer Service Script 
    ‚Üì
MindsDB AI Summary Agent + Classification Agent
